# Movie-Recommended-System
This is an interactive web-based movie recommender app built with Streamlit. It suggests similar movies based on a selected title using a content-based filtering approach (cosine similarity on movie features). It also fetches movie posters and trailers in real-time from the TMDB API, and displays them with an appealing UI background.
